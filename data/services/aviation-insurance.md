### Personl Accident
Aviation Personal Accident Insurance This type of policy covers accidental bodily injury, resulting in death or disablement suffered whilst embarking, or disembarking an aircraft. Disablement can be: Temporary Total : Physical injury which necessarily and continuously disables, or Permanent Total : Physical injury which permanently and completely disables the insured from his business or occupation on.

###  Loss Of Licence Insurance
Professional air crew and certain other specialists engaged in the aviation industry such as flying instructors, air traffic control staff and pilots are only permitted to perform their duties if they hold a valid licence. Such licences must be renewed at intervals and the holder must on each occasion satisfy the medical examiner of the issuing authority as to his fitness to perform flying or other duties. After an illness or accident, the licence holder may fail to pass his medical examination and his licence may be suspended, or if the effects are permanent, withdrawn thereby rendering loss of his licence. Loss of licence policies are therefore issued to pilots and flying engineers to provide for the payment of an insured sum for periodical payments.
