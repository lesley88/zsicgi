## Fire Insurance Services

### Fire Insurance
**Standard Policy** Covers building, machinery, stock, fittings and fixtures against damage or destruction by FIRE and LIGHTENING and limited explosion.

**Extensions** The standard policy can be extended to cover against damage or destruction by full explosion, earthquake, riot, and strike, malicious damage, bush fires and storm, flood impact etc.

### Consequential Loss Insurance
In addition to material damage that may occur to buildings, machinery, stock, fittings and fixtures, financial loss can occur due to the interruption of normal business and as a result of damage to, or destruction of buildings, machinery, raw materials and stock, by fire and/or other perils normally covered by a Fire Policy. After such destruction or damage, business ceases and income ceases to be derived but workers may still be retained and paid and other standing charges like electricity, rent and interest may continue to be incurred. The “Consequential Loss” Policy provides cover for lost income due to interruption and also standing charges and increases in cost of working during the insured period or until such interruption ceases, which ever comes earlier.

### Office Comprehensive 
This Policy provides very wide cover for office owners and tenants. The policy does not only cover damage to, or destruction of office furniture, fixtures and fittings but also covers:

<ul class="features-list">

<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Tenants legal liability to the owner of building</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Loss of rent due to destruction of the building</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Out of pocket expenses incurred by the insured in consequence of the offices being rendered untenable by the insured perils</li>
</ul>

To make it even more comprehensive, this policy can be extended to cover:

<ul class="features-list">
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Loss of money in transit or on the premises</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Accidental damage to office machines (all risks)</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Public liability</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Loss of documents.</li>
</ul>

<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Personal effects not otherwise insured belonging to the visitors whilst in the insured's private residence only.</li>
<li><i class="fas fa-check"></i>Other contingencies covered under this policy are:
